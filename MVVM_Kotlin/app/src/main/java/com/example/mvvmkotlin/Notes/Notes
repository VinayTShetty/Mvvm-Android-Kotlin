SharedView Model

Its a regular view model class sharing its instance with mulitple ViewModel.

Normal View Model
When we instatinate the regular view model in a fragment,Its often scoped to lifecycle of the fragment.
By scoping it to single Fragment we cannot share Data with Multiple fragments.

To share the data between ViewModel and Mulitple fragment we need to instatinate viewmodel with activity.
Using this concept we can share the multiple instance of the same view model to different fragments.
